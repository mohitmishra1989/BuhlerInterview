default:
section defines the default settings for all the jobs. It specifies the Docker image to use (buhlergroup.azurecr.io/build-agent-linux:latest) and the tag (linux).

Stages:
Define the total stages in the pipeline. It has 2 stages called test and EnsureBlobBackup

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running Pester tests from push event..."
    - echo "Running on environment dev"
    - pwsh -Command "./source/Backup/Backup_Blob/Run-EnsureScript.ps1 -Environment dev -ExcludedTags 'DeletedState'"
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - artifacts/
    when: always
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event" || $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "push"

line number 7 represents the test job that runs in the test stage.
line number 9 represents that it has a collection of independent commands
line number 10 will print "Running Pester tests from push event..."

line number 11 will print "Running on environment dev"
line number 12 (3rd command of script section) will run Run-EnsureScript.ps1 script in powershell (pwsh) and pass the excludedtags parameter value.

The artifacts section specifies that the artifacts/ directory should be saved as an artifact, regardless of the pipeline's outcome
The rules section specifies that this job should only run if the pipeline was triggered by a merge request event or a push event


.EnsureBackup_template: &EnsureBlobBackup_definition
  stage: EnsureBlobBackup
  script:
    - pwsh -Command "./source/Backup/Backup_Blob/Run-EnsureScript.ps1 -Environment $Environment -ExcludedTags $ExcludedTags"
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule"

This section defines a template for the EnsureBlobBackup stage. It includes a PowerShell command that runs a script with environment and excluded tags parameters.
the rules section specifies that this job should only run if the pipeline was triggered by a scheduled event.


EnsureBlobBackup_dev:
  <<: *EnsureBlobBackup_definition
  when: always
  rules:
    - if: $Environment == "dev"

This section defines a job named EnsureBlobBackup_dev that inherits from the EnsureBlobBackup_definition template.
this section will always run and it's regardless of the previous job results.
The rules section specifies that this job should only run if the environment is dev

Same goes for the production section.
